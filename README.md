# FESNet: Fine-grained Electromyography Segmentation Network

FESNet is a deep learning-based segmentation network specifically designed for fine-grained analysis of electromyography (EMG) signals. The network leverages inter-intra channel feature extraction blocks combined with multi-head self-attention mechanisms to improve the understanding and prediction of finger movements based on EMG data.
